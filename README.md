## Hacking Graphite

Hacking Graphite is a series of tutorials that uses Graphite's main code base as the entry point to learning cool things about JavaScript, Blockstack, decentralized apps, encryption, and more.

You'll find a folder with all of the tutorials in the source code here. Each tutorial will include the code discussed in the tutorial article as well as any supplemental code. For example, the API tutorial also includes a fake eCommerce site that utilizes the public API created in the tutorial.
